# Wager

## History

[Wager](https://wager.ga/) is a project I started in 2018. (You can find screenshots of the old app [here](https://begue.cc/)). The goal was to create a football prediction game I could play with my friends.

The idea was good, and I reached ~100 users at its prime. 4 years later, while the previous codebase is still working, it is old and fairly unmaintable.
I've therefore decided to restart it completely, new techs, new experience and new goals.
